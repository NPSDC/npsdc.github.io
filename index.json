Interpreting the functional consequences of DNA methylation requires integration of multiple forms of data. The recent advancement in the next generation sequencing can help to decode this relationship and in biomarker discovery. In this study, we investigated the methylation patterns of Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) and its relationship with the gene expression using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) multi-omics data. We found that the promoter and body of tumor suppressor genes, microRNAs and gene clusters and families including cadherins, protocadherins, claudins and collagens are hypermethylated in PRCC. Hypomethylated genes in PRCC are associated with the immune function. The gene expression of several novel candidate genes including interleukin receptor IL17RE and immune checkpoint genes HHLA2, SIRPA and HAVCR2 shows significant correlation with the DNA methylation. We also developed machine learning models using features extracted from single and multi-omics data to distinguish early and late stages of PRCC. A comparative study of different feature selection algorithms, predictive models, data integration techniques and representations of methylation data was performed. The Group Lasso (GL) model using both the gene expression and DNA methylation features shows the overall best performance in distinguishing tumor stages. In summary, our study identifies PRCC driver genes and proposes predictive models based on both DNA methylation and gene expression. These results on PRCC will aid in targeted experiments and provide a strategy to improve the classification accuracy of tumor stages.","tags":[],"title":"Integrative analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression in Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma (under review)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Noor Pratap Singh**","Bapi Raju","Vinod PK"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535760000,"objectID":"51c77c26efa8e470d07fdb3f86036e4f","permalink":"npsdc.github.io/publication/bisp/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"npsdc.github.io/publication/bisp/","section":"publication","summary":"Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma (PRCC) is a heterogeneous disease with variations in disease progression and clinical outcomes. The advent of next generation sequencing techniques (NGS) has generated data from patients that can be analysed to develop a predictive model. In this study, we have adopted a machine learning approach to identify biomarkers and build classifiers to discriminate between early and late stages of PRCC from gene expression profiles. A machine learning pipeline incorporating different feature selection algorithms and classification models is developed to analyse RNA sequencing dataset (RNASeq). Further, to get a reliable feature set, we extracted features from different partitions of the training dataset and aggregated them into feature sets for classification. We evaluated the performance of different algorithms on the basis of 10-fold cross validation and independent test dataset. 10-fold cross validation was also performed on a microarray dataset of PRCC. A random forest based feature selection (varSelRF) yielded minimum number of features (104) and a best performance with area under Precision Recall curve (PR-AUC) of 0.804, MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient) of 0.711 and accuracy of 88% with Shrunken Centroid classifier on a test dataset. We identified 80 genes that are consistently altered between stages by different feature selection algorithms. The extracted features are related to cellular components - centromere, kinetochore and spindle, and biological process mitotic cell cycle. These observations reveal potential mechanisms for an increase in chromosome instability in the late stage of PRCC. Our study demonstrates that the gene expression profiles can be used to classify stages of PRCC.","tags":[],"title":"Machine learning models to predict the progression from early to late stages of papillary renal cell carcinoma","type":"publication"}]
